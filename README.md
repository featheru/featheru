### Hi there 👋

I'm Russell

I'm a full-stack dev working at Thornton Tomasetti, a building engineering company, getting a second bachelors degree from Oregon State University in Computer Science, after a career as a structural engineer. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 👨‍💻 At TT I am working in C# on updated graph traversal, and automated steel connection design 
- 🦫 At School and on the Side I am working on a Zillow API game w/ JavaScript technologies, and a future game project on the side (started with Python, going to switch to C#/Unity potentially)
- 🏒 Fun fact: I like to play hockey in the cold
