### Hi there 👋

I'm Russell

I'm a full-stack dev working at Thornton Tomasetti, a building engineering company, getting a second bachelors degree from Oregon State University in Computer Science, after a career as a structural engineer. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on structural engineering tools at work in C# including graph traversal, and automated steel connection design while working on a Zillow API game w/ JavaScript technologies, and a future game project on the side (started with Python, going to switch to C#/Unity potentially)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🏒 Fun fact: I like the cold and I like to play hockey
